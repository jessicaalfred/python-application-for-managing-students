# Python application for managing students

This is a Student Management System using **Tkinter**.<br>
The marks are visualized using **Matplotlib** and the image can be saved in the local machine.<br>
It also displays current weather and Quote of the day which is fetched using web scrapping by **beautiful-soup** in Python. <br>
All validations are done for taking input. <br>
All the student data is stored in a Database with 'roll number' as the primary key.<br>
